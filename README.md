### cloud-sync
* Runs as Elasticsearch plugin.    
* CloudSync uses Elasticsearch Snapshot and Restore API's and provides a "streaming service" to move data 
from one cluster to another cluster. 
 

##### Use Case(s)
1. Provides a simple, cost effective way of moving existing Elasticsearch indices from on-prem cluster to Cloud.
1. Currently this is developed and test with GCP. AWS support is more of test effort.
1. This supports moving 100's of terabytes of Elasticsearch indices.     
1. Support blue/green deployment process. We want to do this with (almost) zero downtime.
1. Provides visibility on the sync progress.

##### Pre-Requisites
1. Your Elasticsearch version
    1. You can find this by running: 
    `
    curl localhost:9200
    `
1. Distribute the compiled zip file to /home/logrhythm on both the sink and source nodes.
1. If either the sink or source is an elasticsearch cluster the plugin will need installed on all nodes.


##### CloudSync Install


1. Install cloudsync
    1. On both source and sink clusters.
    `
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///home/logrhythm/cloud-sync-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.zip
    `
1. Install GCS plugin
    1. Download GCS plugin from: https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch-plugins/repository-gcs/repository-gcs-5.6.3.zip
       NOTE: The version in repository-gcs-<version>.zip should match your es version.
    1. On both source and sink clusters.
    `
    /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-plugin install file:///home/logrhythm/repository-gcs-5.6.3.zip
    `
       NOTE: If you receive an `Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Could not resolve placeholder 'DX_ES_BOX_TYPE'`
       message you will need to follow these instructions: https://confluence.logrhythm.com/display/CYAN/Install+a+Elasticsearch+plugin for DX_ES_BOX_TYPE and VIRTUAL_HOSTNAME variables.
    1. Follow steps from: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/plugins/5.6/repository-gcs-usage.html
    1. Distribute your gcp service account key to each node that is not a compute instance.
    1. If necessary, create a new keystore: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/5.6/secure-settings.html
    NOTE: If you create the keystore while you are root you may need to chown/chmod the `/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.keystore` file.
    1. Adding GCS creds to the Elasticsearch keystore. (On Source)
     `
     /usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/elasticsearch-keystore add-file gcs.client.default.credentials_file <path_to_file>/<name_of_service_account_key>.json
     `
    1. If Sink cluster is on GCP, it shouldnâ€™t need GCS creds in Elasticsearch keystore.


##### CloudSync API
1. Start the Source:  
    `
    PUT /cloudsync/start
    {
        "mode" : "source",  
        "store" : "fs",             
        "indices" : "logs-*",
        "location": "/mount/cloudsync_backup",
    }
    ` 
    1. Other stores supported: aws-s3, gcp..
    1. This needs to be issued with every restart.
    
1. Start the Sink:
    `
    PUT /cloudsync/start
    {
        "mode" : "sink",
        "store" : "fs",
        "location": "/mount/cloudsync_backup",
    }
    `

1. Curl examples for 'filesystem' nfs store. 

    1. Start Source
    `
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/cloudsync/start" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "mode": "source",
      "store": "fs",  
      "indices": "logs-*",
      "location": "/opt/lr/cloudsync"
    }'
    `    
    1. Start Sink
    
    `
    curl -X POST "localhost:9201/cloudsync/start" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
        "mode": "sink",
        "store": "fs",  
        "indices": "logs-*",
        "location": "/opt/lr/cloudsync"
    }'
    `
1. Curl examples for 'gcs' store 
    1. Start the source

    `
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/cloudsync/start" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "mode": "source",
      "store": "gcs",  
      "indices": "logs-*",
      "location": "dx_cloud"
    }'
    `
    1. Start the sink
    `
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/cloudsync/start" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
      "mode": "sink",
      "store": "gcs",  
      "indices": "logs-*",
      "location": "dx_cloud"
    }'
    `

1. Sync Status on source cluster 
   
    `GET /cloudsync/status`

    `curl localhost:9200/cloudsync/status`
##### Development

1. Built using maven.
1. Elasticsearch plugin need to have exact version as Elasticsearch. To build for different versions change pom.xml
    `<properties>
        <elasticsearch.version>5.6.3</elasticsearch.version>
    </properties>
    `
1. cloud-sync-<version>.zip is found in `target/releases/` after `mvn clean install`

##### Backlog
1. Fix response header type missing.     
1. Tested only when this plugin is installed to singe node in cluster. Support multiple nodes for high availability.


#### FAQS

1. "failed":"no such index"  => your indices patterns resolved to zero indices on source cluster.

#### Quick Reference: Elasticsearch Snapshot & Restore API

1. Verify repository is present
    `
    curl -X POST "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/_verify"     
    `
1. Create repository
    `
    curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{
        "type": "fs",
        "settings": {
            "location": "/opt/lr/cloudsync",
            "compress": true
        }
    }'
    `
    
1. Delete repository 
  1. All snapshots must be deleted before this operation)
    `
    curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup"
    `   

1. Snapshot an index:
    `
    curl -X PUT "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/snapshot_1" -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d'
    {
    
      "indices": "logs-2017-10-21",
      "ignore_unavailable": true,
      "include_global_state": false,
      "chunk_size": "10m"
    }'
    `

2. Check indexInfo status: 
    `curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/snapshot_1/_status?pretty"`

3. Delete a indexInfo: 
    `curl -X DELETE "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/snapshot_1"`

4. Restore a indexInfo: 
    `curl -X POST "localhost:9201/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/snapshot_1/_restore"`

5. List of all utils  
    `curl -X GET "localhost:9200/_snapshot/cloudsync_backup/_all?pretty"`
